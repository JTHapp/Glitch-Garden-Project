I commented out all additions that I made in the Attacker.cs and Health.cs for performing Health checks on the Attacker. The project should run, on your end, exactly how it runs for me after completing Lesson 171 of the course.

My LivesDisplay is different than Rick's. Based on the Difficulty setting, I use sprites to show Lives. A Difficulty setting of "Really Not Easy" will give the player the fewest Lives. That is my current setting, but I don't know if that setting will persist through to your end.
